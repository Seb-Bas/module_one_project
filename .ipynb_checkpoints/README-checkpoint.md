## Goals of ReadMe

Explaination of our process and delieverables that Micorsoft can expect from us.


## Assumptions

Microsoft is starting a streaming platform.  The want this Brand to become the market dominate platform and need to make a "big splash" with its introduction.  

Microsoft wants data insights and recommendations to decide what type of movie they should produce.  They want to "roll-out" a movie that receives a lot of recognition to help "kick-start" the adoption of their new streaming platform.  They want to gain initial market momentum to overtake Netflix & Amazon.  

The main goal for Microsoft is to get market momentum.  Itâ€™s not necessarily to make money on the movie.  Of course, that would be nice.  Therefore, much of the financial aspect of this project has focused on profits and less on costs.  

## Data Collection, Cleaning & Normalization

Collected & saved standard data files to main data file as well as adding more data from other data sources needed for Microsoft specific project. Two databases had most of the useful data for this project:
TMDb Movies
Oscars Data

After exploring each file, we summarized the raw data sets into topcs and their features to quickly references which data is need to validate Micrsoft investiment.  Finally joined various data sources and elminated duplicates to have the most accurate projections possible.

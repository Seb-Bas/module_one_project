## Goals of ReadMe

Explaination of our process and delieverables that Micorsoft can expect from us.


## Assumptions

Microsoft is starting a streaming platform.  The want this Brand to become the market dominate platform and need to make a "big splash" with its introduction.  

Microsoft wants data insights and recommendations to decide what type of movie they should produce.  They want to "roll-out" a movie that receives a lot of recognition to help "kick-start" the adoption of their new streaming platform.  They want to gain initial market momentum to overtake Netflix & Amazon.  

The main goal for Microsoft is to get market momentum.  Itâ€™s not necessarily to make money on the movie.  Of course, that would be nice.  Therefore, much of the financial aspect of this project has focused on profits and less on costs.  

## Data Collection, Cleaning & Normalization

Collected & saved standard data files to main data file as well as adding more data from other data sources needed for Microsoft specific project. Two databases had most of the useful data for this project:
TMDb Movies
Oscars Data

After exploring each file, we summarized the raw data sets into topics and their features to quickly references which data is need to validate Microsoft investment.  Finally joined various data sources and eliminated duplicates to have the most accurate projections possible. 

## Questions Answered by Data (Recommendations)

# Genre
Film genre biggest factor of winning an Oscar.  Dramas have won the most Oscars.  Microsoft must produce a drama.  In addition, if Microsoft would like to increase both revs and profits, then they should invest into drama comedy.  It doesn't decrease the odds of winning Oscars but much at all but does significantly increase profitability


# Diretor
It's critical for Microsoft to next focus on selecting director after moving forward with genre recommendation.  We provided two tiers of directors to recruit as well as other options.  By the way, some profit expectations:   

Tier 1 directors average profits are between 250 to 350m
Tier 2 directors average profits are between 150 to 250m

# Director and Actors
Investing into successful actors and directors should provide a baseline of revenue expectations to limit financial risks.  In addition, certain directors and actors have a history of winning oscars; therefore, focusing on hiring them are key to goal of getting Oscar nominations.  

Tier 1 actors average revs are between 450m to 575m in revs.  
Tier 2 actors its between 425m to 450m.
